# CVE Notifier

This project is a FastAPI application that fetches the latest CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) data from the NVD (National Vulnerability Database) and sends notifications for high and critical severity CVEs to a specified Telegram chat.

## Features

- Fetches CVEs from the NVD API published in the last day.
- Filters CVEs based on keyword and severity (only HIGH and CRITICAL).
- Sends notifications via Telegram.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI
- HTTPX
- Aiogram
- Uvicorn

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cve-notifier.git
    cd cve-notifier
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up environment variables:
    Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following content:
    ```sh
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
    TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_telegram_chat_id
    ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the FastAPI application:
    ```sh
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```

2. Access the application:
    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

To search for CVEs and send notifications, make a GET request to the `/search-cves/` endpoint with a `keyword` query parameter. For example:

This will fetch CVEs containing the keyword "php" that were published in the last day and send notifications for those with HIGH or CRITICAL severity to the specified Telegram chat.

To search for CVEs related to "php" and notify via Telegram:
```sh
curl "http://localhost:8000/search-cves/?keyword=php"
```
## Notes

- Ensure that your Telegram bot token and chat ID are correctly set in the environment variables.
- The application fetches CVEs from the last day only. Adjust the code if you need a different date range.
